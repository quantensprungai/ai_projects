Geoffrey Hinton (Nobelpreis Physik 2024) erinnert: „Wir wissen nicht, ob wir die Kontrolle behalten“ – deshalb zählen Signale und Mechanismen, nicht Stichtage.

Geoffrey Hinton, often called the Godfather of AI, received the Nobel Prize in 2024 for his groundbreaking work on neural networks.

In his acceptance speech, he didn’t just celebrate progress; he warned us:

👉 AI is already creating echo chambers, fueling scams, and enabling mass surveillance.

👉 Soon, it could be building autonomous weapons or even digital beings smarter than us with no guarantee we can control them.

His message was clear: the risks are real, and urgent action is needed.

Innovation has always come with responsibility. The question now is: how do we balance the race for progress with the duty to protect people and society?

What do you think? Are we moving fast enough or too fast? 🤔
