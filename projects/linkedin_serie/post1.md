McKinsey: 5.000 Menschen raus, 12.000 AI-Agenten rein. 

Das ist strukturelle Transformation. Heute.

Während deutsche Institutionen graduelle KI-Integration bis 2035 planen. 

Diese Timeline-Diskrepanz analysierte ich bereits: "Der KI-Splitter: Warum Deutschland die AGI-Timeline verschläft" https://lnkd.in/ePr76f2c

Heute Abend folgt Teil 2: Die internationale AGI-Evidenz zeigt, warum wir umdenken müssen.

5,000 consultants out. 12,000 AI agents in.
McKinsey & Company just made one of the boldest moves in consulting history.
They’ve shifted from “AI will assist” to “AI will deliver.”

These aren’t pilots.
They’re AI agents embedded in tax, advisory, research, and delivery, doing work humans used to bill for.

The facts:
- 5,000 fewer consultants, many others reskilled.
- 12,000 AI agents in use, shrinking teams from 4 people to just 2–3 + AI.
- AI “Lilli” handles 500k+ prompts/month, saving 50k consulting hours.
- 25% of projects are outcome-based (paid for results, not time).
- AI & tech advisory = ~40% of $16B revenue.
- Client satisfaction? Up. Delivery speed? Faster.

How do you feel about this?
